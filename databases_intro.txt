d) 98.7 = Float

2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

**Answer**

Databases are used to store larger amounts of data. A database system allows for data to be quickly read and changed and is ideal for when data must persist beyond the end of the program. A text file should be used when there will not be too many changes made to a shared database, and there is little risk of a first contributor's data being override by a second contributor's data entries. 


3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

**Answer**

Unlike many programming languages, SQL is a declarative rather than a procedural language. As such, we don't have to define an algorithm for how the database should search; instead, we tell the database what we are looking for and the database engine determines the most efficient way to return that data.


4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

**Answer**

Databases display data using a table structure with columns that define what the data represents, and rows that make up a conceptual unit. Then they use a language called SQL to query and manipulate the data found in the database.


5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

**Answer**

Table = A structure with columns and rows.
Row = Makes up a conceptual unit in a table.
Column = Defines what that data in a table represents.
Value = Some piece of information that the column name describes.

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

3. Float
